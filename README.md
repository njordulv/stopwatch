# Stopwatch App

A simple and elegant stopwatch application built with React and Vite. This application allows users to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch, displaying time in milliseconds for precise timing.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Start and stop the stopwatch with a single button click.
- **Reset Functionality**: Reset the stopwatch to zero.
- **Smooth Hand Animation**: The stopwatch hand moves smoothly to represent elapsed time.
- **Numerals Display**: Displays numerals around the watch face, similar to a traditional clock.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes.
- **Millisecond Precision**: The stopwatch increments by milliseconds for accurate timing.
- **Customizable Appearance**: The stopwatch can be styled with different colors and sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that serves your code via native ESM.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for animations in React applications.
